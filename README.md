# mac_cro_screen_macro
A screen macro in Python for Mac OS - because you'd otherwise have to buy one

Most decent thing inthe MacOSX evironmen are PREMIUM. You pay to download, upgrade, etc.
Common utilities that users of Windows can download and use for FREE all sit behind $ buttons in the Mac OS.

Do I really need to pay money for s program that will click on one spot for my screen?
Is it fun to only trial version of basic functionality?

*Absolutely not*

the Mac screen macro does something very simple
- get the current position of the mouse
- begin left-clicking
- stop left-clicking if the mouse moves from its initial position

I later changed it to
- PAUSE when the mouse moves outside of a certain range/radius of the inital mouse position
- RESUME clicking when the mouse return within that radius

This FREE clicker that works on Mac OS, is perfect for games.
